# To-supply-leftover-food-to-poor
Every day, a large amount of edible food is wasted by restaurants, households, and event organizers, while millions of people go hungry.  This project aims to address both problems simultaneously by building a system that collects surplus food and delivers it to people in need, reducing food waste and supporting community welfare.
